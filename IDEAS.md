# HACKATHON IDEAS:

1. Open source projects mailing list tracker (sentiment analys-isish?) 
	- inspiration: https://robmensching.com/blog/posts/2024/03/30/a-microcosm-of-the-interactions-in-open-source-projects/	
		- given recent xz attack - hacker took maintainer's role since original maintainer was burnt out and being pressured by contributors
		- if there was a way for central authorities to flag maintainers in need of support, could have been prevented 
		- Could use gemini's large context window for: 
			- flagging messages 
			- summarize struggles/issues maintainer is going through (giving proof - pointing to specific messages)
			- classify the problem (too much too handle, mental health down, etc) - could influence solution
			- calculate risk score based on the number of flagged messages (not gemini, but we can use the number of flagged messages to do so)
		- Enable central maintainer (linus and his team xd) to track and suface risk across projects
		
1.  Given analysis, search research papers/academia/books for accurate evidence/summaries 

1. Study Assistant - real time quizzing/knowledge checkin while watching lecture, exam prep, practice questions, conceptual diagramming
		- create personalized learning paths, adjust based on student responses/performance, based on piazza posts too ? ? ?idk
		- create study guides based on lectures
		- student can ask "how to learn more about [TOPIC]" and we can tell them exact timestamp in video to look at, and exact practice problems to do, and give more maybe

1.  Editing video footage ? 

1. Company specific interview prep package? idk idk might already be done?? or too basic?? lol
	- using all common interview questions, from leetcode, glassdoor, advice from reddit?, company website, application, youtube videos, tells u what to focus on idk
	- gives mock interview/feedback?  ?? ? ?  

1. test case generator ? ? ? based on large code base and stuff from online related to ur code??
